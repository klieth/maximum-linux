Maximum Linux
=============

Installs some useful programs and then configures vim and tmux in a standard way.

At the moment, this only works with Arch Linux, but I'd like to see it work with other systems as well. Pull requests appreciated.

## What comes with it?

Check out square/maximum-awesome for a pretty good list. Check out the config files for a complete list.

## Install

```
rake
```

## Uninstall

This hasn't yet been implemented. Feel free to submit a pull request.
